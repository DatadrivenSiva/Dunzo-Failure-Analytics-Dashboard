1. Unit Economics Collapse

Monthly orders dropped from 7M per month (2023) to 0 by mid-2024

Funding halted, left with 0.5 months cash runway

🧠 Root Causes of Failure

Unsustainable economics: scaling volume while losing money per order

Delivery workforce collapse due to partner dissatisfaction

Poor inventory & fulfilment systems leading to cancellations

Dependence on investor funding, without profitability path

🧾 Lessons Learned

Growth without profitability is a short-term illusion

Happy delivery partners = successful delivery business

CAC must always be lower than LTV

If investors stop funding, operational collapse is immediate

🏁 Conclusion

Dunzo’s shutdown highlights the consequences of prioritizing rapid expansion while ignoring profitability. Despite strong support from Reliance & Google, losing ₹6,000+ per order and burning ₹7,288 Cr led to bankruptcy. Within 18 months, Dunzo fell from 7M monthly orders to complete shutdown.

Key Takeaway: Scaling fast only works when every order contributes positively to profit.

2.Month with Highest Orders Revenue
WITH max_rev AS (
  SELECT MAX(revenue_cr) AS m FROM financials
)
SELECT year, month, revenue_cr

3.Category-wise Revenue Contribution
SELECT
  category,
  SUM(category_revenue_cr) AS total_category_revenue_cr,
  ROUND(SUM(category_revenue_cr) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(category_revenue_cr)) OVER (), 2) AS pct_of_total

4.Profit Margin % Per Year
Profit margin = (Revenue - Expenses) / Revenue * 100

7.YOY Revenue Growth
Use window function LAG():
SELECT
  year,
  SUM(revenue_cr) AS revenue_cr,
  LAG(SUM(revenue_cr)) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_revenue_cr,
  ROUND(SUM(revenue_cr) - LAG(SUM(revenue_cr)) OVER (ORDER BY year), 4) AS revenue_growth_cr,
  ROUND(
    CASE WHEN LAG(SUM(revenue_cr)) OVER (ORDER BY year) IS NULL THEN NULL
         WHEN LAG(SUM(revenue_cr)) OVER (ORDER BY year) = 0 THEN NULL
         ELSE (SUM(revenue_cr) - LAG(SUM(revenue_cr)) OVER (ORDER BY year)) / LAG(SUM(revenue_cr)) OVER (ORDER BY year) * 100
